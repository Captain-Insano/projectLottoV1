Module: 	Level 8 - Programming Principles	
CA:		Lotto Project – PAIR project
Value:	15% of Module Mark
Due Date:	Fri 22nd April 2016
Duration:	3 weeks


Lotto Project – DkIT Lottery wants you to design, code, document and test a software system.
Four numbers are picked at random every week in the range [1,20]
Lotto players pay €2 and choose 4 numbers 
Player(s) who match 4 numbers  share the Jackpot
Player(s) who match 3 numbers  get a consolation €50 each

Version 1 (30 %)   Basic version - One sample run of the Lotto game.
a) Lotto Jackpot amount entered by user.
b) Player names and numbers are stored directly in arrays in the code – display names & values.
c) Winning random numbers generated – display them, sorted.
d) Display a particular player’s numbers.
e) Identify any Jackpot winner(s).
f) Identfy any Match 3 winner(s).
g) Display the players’ names that are longer than 10 characters.
Version 2 (25 %)  Improve the interface to the system 
a) Deal with duplicates – both in player numbers and winning numbers.
b) Display names with corresponding selected numbers in alphabetical order.
c) Check that the numbers selected by players are valid – inform user of invalid data in array. 
d) Display all names (and numbers) of those players whose names start with particular letter.
e) Display all names (and numbers) of those players who have picked a particular number.
f) Count the number of players whose names contain a particular String (user entered).
g) Display menu of possible options for the system user.
h) 
Version 3 (25 %) Make system more realistic
a) Allow for more than one set of winning numbers – split the jackpot between the winning “match 4” players and limit the amount  paid out to “match 3” winners.
b) Implement multiple “runs” of the game.
c) Allow the set of known players to change their numbers.
d) Jackpot increases 10% on each “run” if it is not won.  Reset to some default if it is won. Jackpot capped at twice the initially entered amount.
e) Create a password-protected administrator-only  menu.
Version 4 (20 %) Implement a substantial documented enhancement of the original project 
Some suggestions:
a) Allow additional players.
b) Analyse multiple runs of the game for any evidence of bias, showing your results as a simple barchart.
c) Deal with payment for the game – temporarily  excluding those who have not paid for this run. Keep track of advance payments - possibly using the date of each run of the game as a reference.
d) Store the data in a file and read it into the arrays for processing.
e) Use a GUI as the user interface.



Note: 
The assignment must be entirely the work of each team. Plagiarised assignments will not be marked, and will be reported to the Head of Department. This applies equally to the team copying and the team whose work is copied.

Technical assistance, guidance and supervision of the project will be provided in class. You will work with your partner in class time.  It is therefore important that you attend class to make the best use of this learning exercise. 
Software Design
Your solution should apply best practices in the design of the software. These include:
(i) appropriate use of methods instead of repeated blocks of code;
(i) use of parameters and return types in method definition;
(ii) decomposition of the functionality of your solution into methods;
(iii) appropriate use of data types;
(iv) easy-to-understand user-interface. e.g. easily navigable menu and prompts for invalid user input;
(v) static class variables (i.e. global variables) used only in very limited circumstances –if at all.

Documentation
The application should be documented appropriately.  You must include:
(i) source code comments in Javadoc style - at least for every class and method.
(ii) a short description (maximum 2 pages) of any tests carried out;
(iii) sample runs of the system - in the form of screen shots;
(iv) short description of any functionality left unfinished or not working properly.

Version 4 - Enhancement 
The original application must be working for version 4 to be attempted.  The additional functionality MUST be documented. Marks awarded will vary depending on degree of difficulty.
Interview
Each team will be required to defend their work in an interview with the lecturer, in the week beginning Apr 25th.  During the interview each student will be asked a number of questions relating to the code submitted. Attendance in this interview is mandatory. Failure to attend will attract a mark of 0% in the project.  A timetable with names and interview times will be made available in Moodle from Friday 22nd Apr.
Submission Requirements
1) The working source code must be submitted (*.java). Comment any code that is not working.
2) All source files and documentation must be submitted in a single (zip format) file.
3) Assignments should be submitted through Moodle.
4) Students must give a signed assignment cover sheet to the lecturer during the week commencing Monday Apr 25th.
